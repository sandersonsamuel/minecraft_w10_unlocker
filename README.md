# Minecraft Unlocker Script

This Python script was developed to bypass the trial license of **Minecraft Windows 10** and grant full access to the game. It **requires administrative privileges** to replace certain system files.

## Requirements

- **Minecraft Windows 10** installed as a trial version. You can get the game [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NBLGGH2JHXJ?hl=pt-br&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare).
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **Administrator Permissions**: The script must be executed with elevated privileges to access and modify system files. You can run it directly from the terminal or configure your IDE to run as Administrator.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Download the Script

Clone or download the repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

### Step 2: Run as Administrator

Before running the script, make sure you have **administrator privileges**:

- **On Windows**: Right-click on **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and choose **"Run as Administrator"**.
- **In an IDE** (like PyCharm or VSCode): Right-click the IDE shortcut and select **"Run as Administrator"**.

### Step 3: Execute the Script

You can run the script in one of the following ways:

#### 1. Using the Terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell)

- Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** **as Administrator**.
- Navigate to the folder where the script is located.
- Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python minecraft-unlocker.py
```

#### 2. Using an IDE (like PyCharm or VSCode)

- Open your IDE **as Administrator**.
- Open the script file inside the IDE.
- Run the script directly from the IDE.

### Step 4: Wait for the Script to Finish

The script will automatically replace the necessary DLLs and unlock full access to **Minecraft Windows 10**. Just wait for it to complete.

### Step 5: Launch the Game

After running the script, open **Minecraft Windows 10** (via the Microsoft Store or Start Menu) to verify that the game is unlocked and fully accessible.

## Notices
